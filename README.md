# Mesh Directory

A lightweight user directory interface built with Next.js and TypeScript. The project explores modern React architecture, component-driven UI design, and data-driven filtering within a responsive directory layout.

This repo serves as a foundation for experimenting with scalable UI structure, state-driven rendering, and iterative product polish.

---

## Features

- User directory interface with searchable/filterable list
- Component-driven layout using modern Next.js patterns
- TypeScript typing for data and UI state
- Responsive design foundations
- Clean separation between UI structure and data layer

---

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- CSS / styling approach (update if Tailwind or other used)

---

## Project Goals

- Explore modern Next.js app structure
- Practice typed UI state management
- Build a reusable directory layout pattern
- Create a foundation for iterative UI/UX refinement

---

## Running Locally

### Install
npm install

### Start
npm run dev

Then open:
http://localhost:3000

---

## Project Structure (high level)

- app/ or pages/ — routing and page composition
- components/ — reusable UI elements
- types/ — shared TypeScript definitions
- data/ or API layer — directory data source

(Adjust to match actual structure if desired.)

---

## Future Improvements

- Figma-driven UI refinement and design iteration
- API-backed data source instead of static data
- Enhanced filtering and sorting capabilities
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance optimizations and memoization where needed

---

## Notes

This project is intentionally lightweight and serves as an iterative playground for UI and architectural exploration rather than a fully featured product.
